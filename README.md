# DevPoint API Website
This will be a public API for the purpose of DevPoint's Backend Database. Testing forms and urls maybe found directly through this repository as well through the [DEVPOINT](https://devpoint.herokuapp.com) heroku website.

## Usage
The webforms for testing the API are not currently up and running but will be in the next week.


##Question For Omar
1. I was having trouble understanding how to incorporate rails into our website, but Freddy advised us to continue working on this sails app and use it just as our api website. Then we could create a separate rails app in a different repo for our dashboard which would control how users input and modify their data. I was wondering if this is a good approach.
2. I was think of having the User Website still hosted through here since we probably wouldn't want to build those on rails. It would seem like over kill to try to do so since we would want to create multiple templates easily. Pure handlebars and html seems like it would do the job just fine. Please advise.
3. As far as securing the api, what would be some good methods for doing so. I would pretty much just want to allow our apps to access the database and no one else. Is there a way for this api to check the incomming request and know that it's comming from an app that we built? Such as our user dashboard?
4. Sails Questions
  * I like the overall structure as to how sails works. It has a similar structure to how ASP.NET worked. You mentioned that in rails there are specific conventions that people usually just stick to?
  * Where would I put specific functions that I would like to be reuseable. For example let's say that I was processing a ton of data coming in the for of CSV and so I have a ton of functions to process that data differently. Where would I store something like that.
  * Under API there is a directory called services. What is that for?
  * I'd like to get a better understanding on tests. Sails come with a built testing capabilities. I'm just not understanding yet how to effectively use tests.
  * What's the grunt file for?
